# Jenkins Pipelines

This repository shows how well-structured Jenkins pipelines can look like. The focus is on hardware tests and software builds. Within the respective use cases, both the [declarative](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#declarative-pipeline) and [scripted](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#scripted-pipeline) pipeline forms are provided.

At the end of each template there is always a call to generate a [test.guide](https://www.tracetronic.de/produkte/test-guide/) compatible JSON report of the pipeline build including logs and stage meta data. For more information see our [Jenkins Library](https://github.com/tracetronic/jenkins-library) on GitHub.
